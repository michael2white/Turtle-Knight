# Turtle-Knight
2D Sidescroller Game (Created in Unity)

This project is a love letter to the amazing indie knight genre of the past 20 years. Gaming has always been a great medium to tell a story while also allowing the players to be a part of that story. Turtle Knight's aim is to spread joy into the world in a fun and adventerous way.

The games that inspired the creation of Turtle Knight come from the 2D side scroller era dating back to the 1990's starting with games such as Megaman X, Super Mario World, Super Ghouls and Ghosts, and Donkey Kong Country. The three most recent inspirations are the master peices Shovel Knight, Hollow Knight and Elden Ring. The same loving spirit these games exemplified is the same spirit that Turtle Knight is born from.

Don Quixote is the last major inspiration for the creation of Turtle Knight. After reading Don Quixote's amazing adventure and having so much joy reading about all the crazy antics of the character, I knew I wanted to capture that spirit in Turtle Knight. The Knight riding a Turtle comes directly from the inspiration of Don Quixote riding a donkey in his adventure instead of a proper steed like most knights. I've always loved turtles so it was too perfect to give our hero an unlikely steed for a knights adventure.
